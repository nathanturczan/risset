## Terminology
- Use "metabar" (no hyphen) to match academic literature (Stowell 2011)

## References
- Stowell, D. (2011). "Scheduling and Composing with Risset Eternal Accelerando Rhythms." Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference 2011.

## Design Philosophy
We are emulating Philip Meyer's approach to packaging and form factor for Max MIDI Tool devices:
- **meyer-devices.com** - Reference for device categories (Generators, Transformers)
- Generators create rhythmic/harmonic patterns from parameters
- Transformers modify existing MIDI data
- Compact, focused UI with intuitive controls
- Emphasis on creative exploration and "grid-defying" rhythmic approaches
- Clean jweb-based interfaces that integrate seamlessly with Live 12 MIDI Tools
